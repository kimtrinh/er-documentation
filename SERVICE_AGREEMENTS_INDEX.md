## 1. EM – Internal Medicine (IM) Agreements

---

### 🟢 EM–IM Non-Member Management Agreement
**File:** `IM and EM Non-member Management 6-29-22.docx`
**Date:** June 16, 2022 (~4 years old)
**Signatories:** Michael Schwartzwald MD (COS EM) & Junaid Sultan MD (COS Hospital Medicine), Kaiser SBC

**Key Rules:**

- **Stable non-member needing IM admit:** EM physician contacts ED case manager, places "discharge planning consult: stable nonmember transfer" order, initiates lateral transfer, completes H&P, and speaks to accepting physician.
- **Bed available:** EM signs transfer paperwork; may endorse to oncoming EM if shift ending.
- **No bed / no ETA:** EM may endorse to oncoming EM OR consult IM depending on complexity/acuity.
- **Wait > 4–6 hours:** EM may consult IM for ongoing management and/or KP admission.
- **Hand-off rule:** Patient formally transfers to IM team when initial EM attending goes off shift. EM continues signing out to incoming EM until then.
- **IM helps with:** Long-LOS patients (GI studies, PEG, IR procedures), complicated boarders, rare KP member transfers, potential AMCAH discharges.
- **If EM unsure about stability for transfer:** IM may be consulted for second opinion. If both agree patient is stable, EM continues transfer. If IM initiates transfer, IM owns ongoing management and transfer paperwork.
- **Escalation:** Disagreements escalate to administrative physician on call for each department.

### 🟡 EM–IM Non-Member Service Agreement (Earlier Version)
**File:** `IM and ER Nonmember Service Agreement.docx`
**Date:** Not dated in document (pre-2022 version)

Earlier version of the non-member management framework. Superseded by the June 2022 agreement above. Use the 2022 version as primary reference.

---

### 🟢 EM–IM Code Sepsis Service Agreement
**File:** `IM and ER Code Sepsis Service Agreement.docx`
**Date:** Not explicitly dated (contains 2020 sepsis algorithm references)

Establishes coordinated sepsis response between ED and IM. See also Sepsis Algorithm files. Core principle: EM initiates sepsis bundle; IM consulted for admission and ongoing management.

### 🟡 Psych–IM Hospitalists–EM Service Agreement (Operational SLA)
**File:** `Psychiatry, IM Hospitalists, and Emergency Medicine Service Agreement.doc`
**Date:** Not dated (estimated 2016–2018 era based on signatories)
**Signatories:** Dr. Maher Kozman (Psych COS), Dr. Margaret Mou (ACOS IM), Dr. Ramona Snipes (EM COS)

**Workflow for medically-cleared psych patients boarding in ED:**

- At **12 hours**: Psych social worker calls ER Charge/EM physician. EM orders IM consult if appropriate for chronic medical management.
- At **24 hours**: Psych social worker calls on-call psychiatrist for medication management.
- **IM Hospitalist** (FMC pager #1604 / OMC pager #81604): Manages medical medication reconciliation and diet until disposition.
- **Psychiatrist**: Manages psychiatric medication reconciliation.
- Psych social worker reassesses every shift; documents disposition status.

### 🟡 Troponin Testing Protocol
**File:** `Kaiser Troponin Testing Memo.doc`
**Date:** August 3, 2016 (~10 years old) 🟡
**Author:** Dr. James Orens, PIC Cardiology, Fontana Medical Center

**High-Sensitivity Troponin Rules:**

| Scenario | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Inpatients | 2 normal troponins ≥6 hours apart (no change) |
| ED → discharge with stress test order | 1 normal troponin ≥3 hours from clearly documented onset of chest pain |
| Troponin #1 indeterminate or positive | 2nd troponin at ≥6 hours from chest pain onset |
| Onset undefined/undocumented | 2 troponins ≥6 hours apart |

**Key notes:**
- Documentation must be specific: "pain started tonight" does NOT meet criteria if drawn same evening.
- Potassium must be 3.5–5.0 (dialysis patients: up to 5.5 acceptable).
- LBBB or paced rhythm → NOT eligible for exercise stress; order **PNL Lexiscan** instead.
- Labs do not replace a thorough H&P.

### 🟡 TSOA (Target-Specific Oral Anticoagulant) Bleeding Management
**File:** `Kaiser Regional Target Specific Oral Anticoagulants (TSOA) Bleeding Management Guideline.docx`
**Date:** ~2015 (references Praxbind FDA approval October 2015) 🟡

**Agents covered:** Dabigatran (Pradaxa), Rivaroxaban (Xarelto), Apixaban (Eliquis), Edoxaban (Savaysa)

**Quick reversal reference:**

| Drug | Reversal Agent | Dose |
|---|---|---|
| Dabigatran | Idarucizumab (Praxbind®) | 5g IV (2 × 2.5g vials) as bolus or infusion |
| FXa inhibitors (apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban) | 4-factor PCC (Kcentra) | 50 units/kg IV, max 5000 units, max rate 8.4 mL/min |
| FXa inhibitors, HIT history | Profilnine (3-factor PCC) | 50 units/kg IV, max 5000 units |
| Overdose/ingestion <4 hrs | Activated charcoal (Actidose) | 50g/240mL via NGT × 1 |

**Severity-based approach:**
- **Mild:** Local hemostatic measures, monitor closely.
- **Moderate:** Fluids, local/procedural hemostasis, transfuse as needed.
- **Severe/Life-threatening:** Reversal agents as above. ⚠️ Reversing dabigatran restores thrombotic risk — restart anticoagulation ASAP when safe.
- **Refractory dabigatran bleed:** Additional 5g Praxbind dose may be considered.
- **FFP: NOT recommended** — insufficient factor concentration, volume overload risk.

**Key pharmacology quick reference:**

| | Dabigatran | Rivaroxaban | Apixaban | Edoxaban |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Half-life (hr) | 12–17 | 7–11 | 9–14 | 10–14 |
| Renal elimination | 80% | 66% | 27% | 50% |
| Hemodialyzable? | Yes (60%) | No | No | No |
| Charcoal window | 2–4 hr | 2 hr | 4–6 hr | 2 hr |

### 🟢 Stroke in COVID-19 Patients Management
**File:** `COVID 19 Ischemic Stroke Management in COVID patients V2.docx`
**Date:** ~2020–2021 (COVID-19 era) 🟢

**Key points:**
- COVID-19 patients have increased stroke risk (systemic inflammatory/pro-thrombotic state).
- Ischemic stroke incidence ~5%, ICH ~0.5%, venous sinus thrombosis ~0.5% of COVID+ patients.
- Risk factors: older age, HTN, DM, prior ischemic disease, elevated CRP, elevated D-dimer, severe COVID.
- Even young asymptomatic patients can have severe LVO strokes.

**IV tPA in known COVID-19:**
- **Must wait for PLT, PT, PTT** before giving IV rtPA (DIC risk / higher bleeding).
- RAPID Abbott testing for all stroke patients ≤60 with embolic-appearing or confirmed embolic stroke (including pre-thrombectomy) — even without classic COVID symptoms.
- Note: After IV tPA, D-dimer rises — account for this when using D-dimer for systemic prognostication.

**Additional workup:**
- D-dimer (quantitative DVT order), Anti-phospholipid Ab panel (lupus anticoagulants, beta-2 glycoprotein Ab, anti-cardiolipin Ab), Fibrinogen.
- CT preferred over MRI for logistical ease.

**Therapeutic anticoagulation indications (duration ≥4 weeks):**
- Embolic stroke unexplained by other mechanism / in setting of hypercoagulable state.
- Positive antiphospholipid antibodies.
- Severely elevated D-dimer >3,000 (especially >10,000).
- Consult Hem/Onc, ID, IM for interdisciplinary guidance on duration.

### 🟡 Neurosurgery ED Transfer Agreement (OMC → FMC)
**File:** `Neurosurgery ED Transfer Agreement.docx`
**Date:** December 14, 2016 (~9 years old) 🟡
**Signatories:** Alp Arkun MD (COS EM) & Todd M Goldenberg MD (COS Neurosurgery)

**Process:**

1. OMC ED physician identifies acute neurosurgical emergency.
2. Calls neurosurgeon on call immediately.
3. Asks specifically: **"Does this patient require or may potentially require an immediate life or limb saving neurosurgical intervention?"**

- **YES** → Activate emergent neurosurgical transfer; neurosurgeon expects patient at FMC ED within **20–30 minutes**.
- **NO** → Joint decision on disposition (hold at OMC, admit to OMC ICU, transfer elsewhere, etc.)

**Emergent Transfer Steps:**
- OMC ED physician notifies OMC Charge RN and FMC ED physician.
- OMC Charge RN calls **911** for emergent transfer (similar to STEMI process).
- OMC Charge RN notifies FMC Charge RN.
- OMC Charge RN attempts to secure ICU bed (does NOT delay transfer).
- Designated OMC ED RN accompanies ALS EMS crew (CCT not used — too slow).
- FMC ED physician assigned and neurosurgeon paged upon patient arrival.
- Neurosurgeon at bedside **within 10 minutes** of FMC arrival.

**Coverage:**
- Fontana: C-call 24 hours, pager 1588
- Ontario: E-call 0200–0600, cell phone

**Initial evaluation (all patients):** Age, G/P, LMP, bleeding quantity, symptoms, vitals, urine pregnancy test.

**STAT labs:** CBC, Quantitative β-HCG, ABO-Rh (if none on file).

**Algorithm:**
- **Stable (mild bleed/cramp):** ED provider manages per algorithm below.
- **Heavy bleeding or severe abdominal/adnexal pain:** Call OB/GYN.

| Ultrasound finding | Action |
|---|---|
| IUP with fetal heart tones | F/U OB 1–2 weeks, SAB precautions, Rhogam if Rh-neg |
| No fetal pole/heart tones | Repeat β-HCG in 72 hrs; route chart to RN case manager |
| No IUP (possible ectopic) | Call GYN if β-HCG ≥1500; if <1500 → route to RN case managers |

**For follow-up β-HCGs:** Route chart via HealthConnect to:
- Ontario: Pam Palmer
- Fontana/Redlands: Karen Sutton or P-16333 (GYN case manager pool)

**Second trimester bleeders (<20 wks):** ED exam, sono, consult GYN as needed.

**OB Trauma:**
- <20 weeks: ED manages. Document FHTs before discharge.
- >20 weeks unstable: Call GYN to assess in ED.
- >20 weeks stable, no OB complaints: Clear from ED, send to L&D.

**Post-op complications:**
- <30 days post-op: Consult GYN.
- >30 days: ED workup + consult GYN as needed.

### 🟡 Deliveries Prior to Arrival Workflow
**File:** `Deliveries Prior to Arrival.docx`
**Date:** Not dated (internal workflow document, estimated 2018–2021) 🟡

**Mom and baby arrive together:**
- **Do NOT register** mom or baby in KPHC.
- Notify PITT provider (ext. 11-2300) to screen and provide blessing.
- If no PITT: call next-up provider (blessing for transport does NOT count toward PSG unless patient is unstable and stays in ED).
- Lay eyes on both personally — do not trust EMS assessment alone.
- Wait for physician assessment before sending upstairs.
- Call L&D charge: notify if going upstairs or staying in ED.

**Mom and baby arrive separately:**
- Notify PITT provider for both (even separate arrivals).
- If one or both stay in ED: register in KPHC, assign to next provider by rotation.
- If blessing for transport: does NOT count toward PSG. If stays in ED: counts.
- Call L&D charge and notify: location and stability of each patient.

### 🟢 Pediatric Appendicitis Service Line Agreement
**File:** `Pediatric Appendicitis Service Line Agreement with Appendicitis.docx`
**Date:** Not explicitly dated (Kaiser CCN document, estimated 2019–2022) 🟢

**Applies to:** Pediatric patients age 0–13 with possible appendicitis at facilities WITHOUT inpatient pediatrics (GMC).

**Process:**
1. GMC ED/Urgent Care MD thinks appendicitis → call local GMC SOD to confirm.
2. If GMC SOD agrees → contact **PTAC** (Pediatric Treatment and Advice Center) to arrange bed + surgeon-to-surgeon handoff.
   - Ages 0–5: Contact **Pediatric Surgery** at STMC.
   - Ages 6–13: Contact **Adult General Surgery** at STMC.
3. If GMC SOD unavailable AND CT positive for appendicitis → GMC ED MD can initiate through PTAC and speak directly with STMC SOD.

**Once transfer confirmed:** STMC SOD creates the case on the STMC OR grease board immediately (search chart by MR# with "search my region") — reduces OR wait even if case later cancelled.

**Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS):**

| Finding | Points |
|---|---|
| Cough/percussion tenderness | 2 |
| Hopping tenderness | 2 |
| RLQ tenderness | 2 |
| Anorexia | 1 |
| Pyrexia | 1 |
| Nausea/vomiting | 1 |
| Leukocytosis (WBC ≥10,000) | 1 |
| PMN neutrophilia | 1 |
| Migration of pain | 1 |
| **Total** | **10** |

- **Score ≥7:** Highly suspicious for appendicitis.
- **Score <5:** Unlikely appendicitis.
- Note: Pediatric CT protocol reduces radiation but may produce more equivocal studies.

### 🟢 Necrotizing Fasciitis (NSTI) Service Agreement
**File:** `Necrotizing Fasciitis Service Agreement.docx`
**Date:** December 22, 2021 (~4 years old) 🟢
**Signatories:** Carie McVay MD (COS General Surgery), Lawrence Albinski MD (COS Ortho), Stephen West MD (COS Plastics), Kaiser SBC

**Diagnosis:**
- Fulminant NSTI = clinical diagnosis → DO NOT DELAY for workup.
- If clear on presentation: first available surgeon → OR immediately.
- Hemodynamically stable with diagnostic uncertainty: work up with LRINEC score.

**LRINEC Score:**

| Lab | Points |
|---|---|
| CRP >150 mg/L | 4 |
| WBC 15–25 | 1 pt; >25 = 2 pts |
| Hgb 11–13.5 | 1 pt; <11 = 2 pts |
| Na <135 | 2 |
| Cr >1.6 | 2 |
| Glucose >180 | 2 |

- Score **>6**: Very concerning for NSTI.
- Score **<5**: Can help rule out if exam/imaging reassuring (cannot be used alone to rule out).

**Imaging:** US (quick, higher false-negative rate) or CT with IV contrast. **Air in soft tissues on CT = highly specific for NSTI → immediate OR**.

**Document clinical photo in HealthConnect** for all consults.

**Consultation algorithm by anatomy:**
- **All NSTI regardless of location:** Consult **General Surgery** first.
- **Distal to elbow:** Gen Surg consults Hand Surgery (Ortho/Plastics) for assistance.
- **Distal to knee:** Gen Surg consults Orthopedic Surgery for assistance.
- **Foot only (NF or not):** Consult **Podiatry** (M–F 0800–1700). After hours → Orthopedics. Gen Surg available as backup.
- **ICU management:** General Surgery is primary.
- **Once stable → floor:**
  - Below elbow → Hand team takes over until discharge.
  - Below knee → Orthopedics takes over until discharge.
  - Above elbow/knee → General Surgery remains primary.
- **Soft tissue coverage (skin graft/flap):** Consult Plastics once wound is clean.

**Non-NSTI soft tissue limb infections:**
- Proximal to elbow or knee → General Surgery
- Distal to elbow → Hand Surgery
- Distal to knee → Orthopedics

### 🟢 Infectious Diarrhea Work-up (Adults)
**File:** `Kaiser Work-up of infectious diarrhea for adults.docx`
**Date:** Not explicitly dated (estimated 2019–2022) 🟢

**Definition:** ≥3 liquid stools in 24 hours. Acute diarrhea is almost always self-limited — supportive care only, no routine antibiotics.

**Testing algorithm:**

| Clinical scenario | Test |
|---|---|
| Antibiotics within prior 1–3 months | C. diff Antigen + Toxins A&B with reflex to PCR [231607], sterile container |
| Immunocompromised (HIV, biologics, chemo) | Call ID on-call |
| Fever + blood in stool + significant dehydration | CBC with diff, BUN/Cr, electrolytes + Bacterial GI Panel (Salmonella, Shigella/EIEC, Campylobacter, Shiga toxin DNA) PCR [87505A], Para-Pak C&S container |
| International travel (excl. Canada/Europe/Israel/Japan) or camping/hiking with diarrhea >1 month | O&P Identification [87177C], Total Fix/OP-99 container |
| Camping/hiking/public pool, diarrhea >1 month | Giardia/Cryptosporidium/E. histolytica EIA with reflex PCR [874490], sterile container |

**Not routinely indicated:** Stool WBC, viral testing, standard culture.

**Antibiotics:** Wait for Bacterial GI Panel results unless severely ill (results usually within 24 hours). Antibiotic recommendation does NOT change based on patient occupation.

### 🟡 Pit Viper Snake Envenomation — CroFab Protocol
**File:** `Pit Viper Snake Envenomation Management using antivenin Crofab Protocol.docx`
**Date:** Not explicitly dated (estimated 2018–2022) 🟡

**Applies to:** Rattlesnake, sidewinder, or copperhead envenomation.
⚠️ If family brings a dead snake: DO NOT handle if head is attached — pit vipers can envenomate reflexively post-mortem.

**Signs of envenomation:** Swelling/tenderness/bruising/bullae at bite site, fasiculations, hypotension, remote bleeding, metallic taste, vomiting, AMS, angioedema/airway compromise.
- 10–20% of bites are "dry" (no envenomation).

**Initial management:**
- ACLS/PALS as needed. Continuous cardiac monitoring, VS q2h.
- 2 large-bore IVs. Remove jewelry/tight clothing (anticipate swelling).
- Mark advancing edema edge with permanent marker + date/time. Repeat q30min initially, then q2h after CroFab started.
- Keep bitten extremity neutral initially; elevate after CroFab started.
- Monitor urine output and color. NPO until stabilized.
- IV NS bolus (rhabdomyolysis common). Pediatric: 20 mL/kg. Avoid large volumes in small infants.
- Pain: IV opioids initially → PO as tolerated. **NO NSAIDs**.
- Update tetanus if needed.
- **No prophylactic antibiotics.**

**Labs:** CBC, PT/INR, PTT, fibrinogen, electrolytes, BUN/Cr, LFTs, CK, type & screen. EKG/CXR if cardiac history. Head CT if AMS/severe HA.

**CroFab dosing (give for any signs of envenomation):**
- **Dry bite:** Observe 8 hours; repeat labs before discharge. No CroFab.
- **Initial dose: 4–6 vials IV.** No pediatric dose adjustment.
- Reconstitute each vial with 18mL NS; rock gently 10 minutes; add all to 250mL NS bag.
- Infuse at 50 mL/hr for first 10 minutes (watch for allergic reaction) → 250 mL/hr if tolerated.

**Assessing initial control (1 hour post-infusion):** Repeat labs. Initial control = swelling progressed <1 inch, pain decreasing, coags normalizing.
- **Not controlled:** Repeat 4–6 vials q2h until controlled.
- **Controlled:** Repeat labs q6h; reassess swelling/pain q2h. Contact toxicology/poison control (1-800-222-1222) for maintenance dosing discussion.

**Admit to MICU or PICU.** Observe ≥24 hours after initial control for delayed effects.

**Follow-up:** Repeat labs q3 days for 2 weeks. Avoid NSAIDs/aspirin and elective surgery/dental for 2 weeks. Non-weight bearing until painless.

**Complications:**
- Hemorrhage unresponsive to CroFab → transfuse.
- Rhabdomyolysis → aggressive IVF; dialysis if myoglobinuric renal failure.
- Compartment syndrome → clinical diagnosis; compartment pressures recommended; consult Ortho or Plastics.

### 🔴 Emergency Release & Hemorrhage Protocol
**File:** `Kaiser Emergency Release & Hemorrhage Protocol - Urgent Need - 7-2013.doc`
**Date:** July 2013 (~13 years old) 🔴

**Emergency Release (uncrossmatched, urgent):**
- Blood Bank issues **up to 2 units RBC within 10 minutes** of phone call.
- FP and platelets only as requested.
- Blood Bank phone: **OMC ext. 42984 | FMC ext. 28080**

**Hemorrhage Protocol (massive transfusion):**
- Triggered by physician or charge nurse.
- Blood Bank issues **4 units RBC within 10 minutes.**
- Thaws 4 units FFP → available within **45 minutes.**
- Issues 1 unit platelets pheresis (order STAT if unavailable).
- Blood Bank **keeps ahead 4 RBC + 4 plasma + 1 platelets** until protocol cancelled.
- The phone call to Blood Bank constitutes a physician order.

**Process:**
1. Call Blood Bank with: your name/extension, patient name/MRN, physician name, transfusion location, confirm 4 RBC + 4 FFP + 1 platelets.
2. Send Blood Bank specimen immediately (if not already in lab).
3. Complete Emergency Release/Hemorrhage Protocol Form (Attachment 1) — bring to Blood Bank.
4. Physician signs Emergency Blood Release Waiver form when crisis subsides and returns to Blood Bank.
5. Place all orders in HealthConnect once stabilized.
6. Cancel protocol when hemorrhage subsides (charge nurse or communication person calls Blood Bank).
7. Conduct debriefing after crisis.

**Uncrossmatched blood types:** Group O (neg or pos depending on supply) OR ABO-compatible if current sample in Blood Bank with confirmed ABO/Rh.

### 🔴 Transfusion Protocol — RBC Guidelines
**File:** `Kaiser Transfusion Protocol.doc`
**Date:** February 4, 2014 (~12 years old) 🔴

| Hemoglobin | Action |
|---|---|
| <7 g/dL | Generally acceptable to transfuse |
| 7–10 g/dL | May transfuse if symptomatic, ACS, acute CHF, orthostatic hypotension, acute renal failure, septic shock with SVO2 <70%, acute hemorrhage with symptoms (tachycardia), or myelosuppressive chemotherapy/disease. History of CAD/CHF alone is NOT an indication — discuss with Cardiology. |
| >10 g/dL | Generally NOT indicated (exception: acute hemorrhagic shock) |

**Notes:**
- Surgical candidates: seek anesthesia input on pre-op Hgb goals.
- Clinical judgment is critical at any Hgb level.
- Documentation of transfusion rationale is **required**.
